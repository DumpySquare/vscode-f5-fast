# The F5 VSCode Extension

If you mention the words "F5" and "API" with any sort of consistency, then you need to be using The F5 VSCode Extension...

The F5 VSCode Extension will not only only supercharge your abilities to write (A)utomated (T)ool(C)hain declarations with snippets, examples and declaration schema validation, but also assist with connecting, deploying, retrieving and updating declarations on F5 devices.

If that wasn't enough to get your attention, the extension can also...

- GET/POST/DELETE of all ATC services, including FAST/AS3/DO/TS
- links to quickly open related ATC documentation
- Direct access to ATC examples from git repo
- Install/UnInstall of ATC rpms
- Convert JSON <-> YAML
- Encode/Decode base64 strings
- Craft generic HTTP REST calls to connected device or external
- Extract TMOS applications (per virtual server)
- Write, deploy and modify iRules/iApps (with vscode-irule extension for language support)
