## onConnect/onDisconnect Commands

The onConnect and onDisconnect commands are configurable via the user settings json file for the extension.  This feature allows commands to be executed on connect and on disconnect of the related device.  

This feature is useful for workflows like automatically connecting over ssh and tailing the logs for a specific device
