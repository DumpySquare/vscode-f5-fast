## get/post/delete/tenants/tasks

Once a device is connected, and the extension detects that AS3 is installed, a status bar will show up on the bottom indicating the running AS3 service verson.  

The AS3 Tenant TreeView on the left shows AS3 tenants and apps for each tenant.  Select a tenant to see all the app configuration details for that tenant.  You cannot select individual apps from the tree, they are just there for visibility

The AS3 Tasks TreeVew on the left is just to provide some visibility into the tasks/jobs that the AS3 service has run. 

To post an AS3 declaration, select the command from the palette by pressing `F1`.  You may need to search for 'as3' or 'f5'.

Select the declaration text to send or it will capture the entire editor window

To delete a tenant, right-click the tenant in the AS3 Tenant TreeView on the left and select `Delete`
