## Examples/Guides

Good guide about Typscript, making/recieving api calls, and developing Typscript apps [https://wanago.io/2019/03/18/node-js-typescript-6-sending-http-requests-understanding-multipart-form-data/]

## Ideas!!!

### Use extension custom data types to assist with declaration building (AS3/DO/TS/FAST):
[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-custom-data]

Maybe even iRules/iApps...?

### Deploy/push template from VS Code like Ansible plugin below

Again, probably something better for an AS3/DO/TS plugin.  Build, send directly to device.

### Use CodeLens API to provide inline editor options, like post highlighted json to device

### Provide a sudo terminal to F5 BIGIP

This would utilize bash endpoint api
Send it a bash/tmsh command, provide the output.
Would allow for quick access to devices without having to acces ssh/gui

VS Code Extension examples

### Extension capabilities interested in using

[Declarative Language Features](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/overview#declarative-language-features)

Declarative Language Features adds basic text editing support for a programming language such as bracket matching, auto-indentation and syntax highlighting. This is done declaratively, without writing any code. For more advanced language features, like IntelliSense or debugging, see Programmatic Language Features.

Extension Ideas

* Bundle common JavaScript snippets into an extension.
* Tell VS Code about a new programming language.
* Add or replace the grammar for a programming language.
* Extend an existing grammar with grammar injections.
* Port an existing TextMate grammar to VS Code.

VS Code Extensions getting started
[https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension]

Contribute menus could be used to add menu options for writing declarations
[https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.menus]

### Provide json object references
Example: show where as3 profile object is referenced
